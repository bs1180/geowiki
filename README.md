This is a quick revamp of the IIASA [GeoWiki](http://www.geo-wiki.org) website.

### Technical 
It uses my preferred toolchain - The [React] javascript framework, but statically compiled for hosting. The CSS is written in Emotion and completely custom, with no external CSS frameworks. This reduces the size of the assets needed to be downloaded when visiting the site (therefore increasing the speed) as well as improving the maintainability of the site, by minimising any dependencies.

Everything is written by hand, and hosted on Netlify.
